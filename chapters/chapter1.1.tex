\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{DBCASE 2.0} offers an easy way to build relational databases from the design of an entity-relationship diagram, the tool allows the user to generate the logical and physical model from the diagram, as well as directly execute the code generated in a DBMS.\\

The main goal of the tool is to guide the user in the process of designing a relational database through all its phases. The tool is designed for users to experiment with different designs in a way that allows them to acquire and establish knowledge.\\

DBCASE is designed from the beginning as a lightweight and cross-platform program, which allows great versatility to be used in any type of environment.\\

From an entity-relationship diagram created by a user, the application is capable of generating its logical model, as well as the physical model adapted to three different database managers: MySQL, ORACLE and MS ACCESS.\\

The application provides a complete solution for all phases of designing a database, as well as being specifically designed for the learning process, which differentiates it from the existing alternatives in the market.
